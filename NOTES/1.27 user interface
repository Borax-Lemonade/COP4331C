1.27 notes on user interface

what not to do for a project
 - dont do it without planning

accessability 
	provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background -- no light grey on white
	dont use color alone to convey info -- think of fellow colorblind folks
	ensure that interactive elments are easy to identify
	provide clear and consistent navigation options -- dont have things underlined if it isnt a hyperlink -- make buttons obvious 
	ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels -- have hint text and label
	provide easily identifiable feedback -- dont have an alert box for everything (for this project only dialogue box is to confirm deletion) 
											-- also the "email address is invalid"
	use headings and spacing to group related content	-- 
	create desings for different viewport sizes
	include image and media alternatives in your design 
	provide controls for content that startrs automatically
